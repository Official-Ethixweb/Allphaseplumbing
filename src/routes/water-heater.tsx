const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does a new water heater cost?",
    a: "It depends on the type and size of unit your home needs, tank vs. tankless, gas vs. electric. We give you a clear, upfront quote after assessing your setup so there are no surprises.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I repair or replace my water heater?",
    a: "If your unit is under 8-10 years old and the repair is minor, a fix usually makes sense. Older tanks that leak or repeatedly fail are often cheaper to replace. We'll give you an honest recommendation, not a sales pitch.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you install tankless water heaters?",
    a: "Yes. Tankless systems give you endless hot water and lower energy bills. We handle sizing, installation, and any gas or venting upgrades required for a safe, code-compliant setup.",
  },
  {
    q: "My water heater is leaking, is that an emergency?",
    a: "A leaking tank can cause serious water damage and should be addressed right away. Turn off the water supply to the heater if you can and call us, we answer 24/7 and offer same-day service.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a water heater installation take?",
    a: "Most standard tank replacements are completed in a few hours the same day. Tankless conversions can take longer depending on gas, venting, and electrical requirements. We'll give you an accurate timeline before we start.",
