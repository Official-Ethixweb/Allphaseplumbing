const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is hydro jetting?",
    a: "Hydro jetting uses highly pressurized water (up to 4,000 PSI) delivered through a specialized nozzle to scour the inside of your pipes. Unlike snaking, which just pokes a hole in a clog, jetting completely cleans the pipe walls.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is hydro jetting safe for old pipes?",
    a: "In most cases, yes. However, we always perform a video camera inspection first to assess the condition of your pipes. If they are too brittle or damaged, we will recommend an alternative solution.",
  },
  {
    q: "Hydro jetting vs. snaking: Which is better?",
    a: "Snaking is great for simple, soft clogs near the drain. Hydro jetting is necessary for severe grease buildup, heavy tree roots, scale, or long-term blockages deep in the main sewer line.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does hydro jetting take?",
    a: "Most residential hydro jetting jobs take between 1 to 3 hours, depending on the severity of the blockage and the length of the sewer line.",
  },
];
