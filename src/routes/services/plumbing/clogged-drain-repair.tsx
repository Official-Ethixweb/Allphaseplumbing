  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Should I try chemical drain cleaner first?",
      a: "We recommend against it. Store-bought chemicals can damage pipes (especially older metal lines) and rarely clear the full clog. They also make professional clearing more hazardous.",
    },
    {
      q: "What's the difference between snaking and hydro jetting?",
      a: "Snaking punches through a clog. Hydro jetting cleans the entire pipe interior. For recurring clogs or grease-heavy lines, jetting is the better long-term fix.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why does the same drain keep clogging?",
      a: "Repeated clogs usually mean buildup in the pipe wall, a partial collapse, or a problem in the main sewer line. We camera-inspect to find the real cause instead of just clearing it again.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can you tell if my clog is local or in the main line?",
      a: "Yes, by checking which fixtures are affected and running a camera if needed. Multiple drains backing up usually points to the main sewer line.",

      q: "How fast can you respond to a backed-up drain?",
      a: "Same day across Seattle for most calls. For sewer backups, we treat it as an emergency and dispatch as quickly as possible.",
