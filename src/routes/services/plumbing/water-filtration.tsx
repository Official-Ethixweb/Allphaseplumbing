        "There's no single best filter, it depends on what's in your water. Chlorine taste is a different filter than iron staining, which is different from heavy metals. We start with a free water test, then recommend the right approach for what you actually need (and avoid expensive systems for problems you don't have).",

      paragraphs: [
        "Whole-home filters treat all water entering the house, great for chlorine, sediment, and overall taste improvement. Point-of-use systems (under-sink, RO) treat just drinking water, best when you want premium drinking quality without the cost of treating water for showers, laundry, and irrigation.",

    {
      q: "Do I need a filter on Seattle city water?",
      a: "Seattle tap water is generally high quality, but many homeowners want to remove chlorine taste, lead from old plumbing, or improve drinking water specifically. A simple under-sink filter often does the job affordably.",
    },
    {
      q: "What about well water?",
      a: "Well water usually needs more comprehensive treatment, sediment, iron, hardness, and sometimes bacteria. We test first and design a system that fits the issues found.",
    },
    {
      q: "What's the difference between a filter and a softener?",
      a: "A softener removes hardness (calcium and magnesium) by ion exchange. A filter removes contaminants like sediment, chlorine, or metals. Many homes benefit from both, we can install a combo system.",
    },
    {
      q: "How often do filters need to be changed?",
      a: "Depends on the system and water quality. Whole-home sediment filters: 3–6 months. Carbon filters: 6–12 months. RO membranes: 2–3 years. We can set up a reminder service.",
    },
    {
      q: "Will a filter slow my water pressure?",
      a: "Properly sized filters have minimal pressure impact. Undersized systems or clogged filters cause noticeable drops, sizing it right at install matters.",
