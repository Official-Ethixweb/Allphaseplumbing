        "Whole-home repiping replaces all of your water supply lines with modern PEX or copper, giving you reliable pressure, clean water, and decades of peace of mind. Our licensed plumbers plan the route carefully to minimize wall openings and complete most jobs in 2–5 days.",

      q: "Do I have to move out?",
      a: "No. There will be short periods without water during the day, but most homeowners stay home through the work.",

      q: "Will you have to cut into every wall?",

      q: "PEX vs. copper, which is better?",
      a: "Both are excellent. PEX is more flexible, freeze-tolerant, and quieter; copper has a longer track record. We'll recommend based on your home and budget.",
