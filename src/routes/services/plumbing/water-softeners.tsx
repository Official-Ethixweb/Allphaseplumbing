      q: "Do I really need a water softener in Seattle?",
      a: "Seattle's tap water is generally on the soft side, but well water and some neighborhoods do see hardness issues. A simple hardness test tells you for sure, we can do this during the first visit.",
    },
    {
      q: "How often should I add salt?",
      a: "Most homes refill every 4–8 weeks. If you're going through salt faster than that, the system may be set to over-regenerate or could have a leak, both worth diagnosing.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long does installation take?",
      a: "A straightforward replacement is typically 2–4 hours. New installations that need plumbing rerouting or a power outlet can take half a day.",
    },
    {
      q: "Will soft water damage my plants or lawn?",
      a: "Watering with high-sodium soft water long-term can affect some plants. We can install the softener so it only treats indoor water, leaving exterior hose bibs hard.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can a softener fix iron or sulfur smells?",
      a: "Some softeners handle low levels of iron, but heavy iron or rotten-egg smells usually need a dedicated iron filter or aeration system. We'll test and recommend the right setup.",
