All Phase Plumbing provides fast, code-compliant pipe repair across the Seattle area for residential and small commercial properties.",

      heading: "When Repair Isn't Enough",
      paragraphs: [
        "If we find widespread corrosion, repeated failures in nearby sections, or pipe material at end of life, we'll tell you straight, patching the same pipe over and over costs more than a planned replacement. See our pipe replacement and repiping services for those options.",

    {
      q: "How do you find a leak inside a wall?",
      a: "We use acoustic listening tools, thermal imaging, and pressure testing to pinpoint the spot before cutting. The opening is precise, not exploratory damage.",
    },
    {
      q: "Will my water bill drop after repair?",
      a: "If the leak was active, yes, sometimes dramatically. We can compare meter readings before and after to confirm the fix.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you handle hot water pipe repairs differently?",
      a: "Same materials and joints, but extra care to support the repaired section because hot water pipe expansion stresses joints over time.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can you repair galvanized pipe?",
      a: "Sometimes, short sections can be transitioned to PEX or copper. If the surrounding galvanized is heavily corroded, partial replacement is usually a better investment.",

    {
      q: "How long does a typical pipe repair take?",
      a: "Most single-point repairs are 1–2 hours including testing. Repairs requiring drywall opening or harder-to-access pipes can take 3–4 hours.",
