        "Slab leaks happen when water pipes running through or under your home's concrete foundation crack, corrode, or shift. Because the leak is hidden under concrete, it often goes undetected until water bills spike, flooring warps, or warm spots show up underfoot. By then, structural damage is usually already underway.",
        "All Phase Plumbing uses non-invasive slab leak detection to pinpoint the exact location of the leak, then offers the right repair approach for your home, from spot repair to full rerouting that avoids the slab entirely.",

      paragraphs: [
        "Before opening any concrete, we use electronic listening equipment, thermal imaging, and pressure isolation to pinpoint exactly where the leak is. This means surgical access instead of guesswork demolition, a smaller hole, a faster fix, and a cleaner patch.",

      heading: "Why Slab Leaks Get Worse Fast",
      paragraphs: [
        "Water under the slab erodes the soil supporting your foundation, can rot subflooring above, and creates conditions for mold. What costs $1,500 to repair this week can become $15,000 in remediation in six months. If you suspect a slab leak, don't wait.",

    {
      q: "Will my insurance cover slab leak repair?",
      a: "Coverage varies. Most policies cover the damage caused by the leak but not the leak repair itself. Documentation of the exact failure helps your claim.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is it better to repair or reroute?",
      a: "Depends on pipe age and history. Single failure in newer pipe, spot repair. Multiple failures or old galvanized pipe, rerouting or repiping is usually smarter long-term.",

      q: "How long does slab leak repair take?",
