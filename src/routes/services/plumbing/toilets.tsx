  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Why does my toilet keep running?",
      a: "Usually a worn flapper, fill valve, or chain length issue. These are inexpensive parts but a slow refill leak can waste hundreds of gallons a month. We replace the failed parts and adjust the tank to stop the running for good.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I know if I need a new toilet vs. a repair?",
      a: "If you've had two or more repairs in a year, the tank or bowl is cracked, or it's a high-water-use model from the 90s, replacement usually pays for itself in water savings within a few years.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you install bidet and smart toilets?",
      a: "Yes. We handle smart and bidet-integrated toilets including the additional water supply and electrical considerations they often need.",
    },
    {
      q: "What causes a toilet to leak around the base?",
      a: "Almost always a failed wax ring or loose flange bolts. Don't wait, water leaking under the toilet can rot the subfloor. We reset the toilet with a new seal and check the flange for damage.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can you replace a toilet during a bathroom remodel?",
      a: "Absolutely. We coordinate with your remodel timeline so the new toilet goes in after flooring and is ready when the rest of the bathroom is finished.",
