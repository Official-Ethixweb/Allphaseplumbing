A buried main line leak can mean wet spots in the yard, dropping pressure, climbing water bills, or no water at all. All Phase Plumbing diagnoses, repairs, and replaces water service lines across the Seattle area.",

        "Where conditions allow, we replace water service lines using trenchless techniques that preserve driveways, patios, and landscaping. We dig small access pits at each end and pull a new HDPE pipe through, saving you thousands in hardscape restoration.",

      q: "Who's responsible, me or the city?",
