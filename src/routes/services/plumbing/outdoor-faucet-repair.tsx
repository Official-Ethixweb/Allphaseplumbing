        "Outdoor faucets are used more than most homeowners realize. From watering lawns and washing cars to filling pools and cleaning outdoor spaces, these fixtures work hard year-round. Because they're exposed to weather and temperature changes, outdoor faucets are more likely to develop problems than indoor plumbing.",

      q: "Should I replace a standard hose bib with a frost-proof one?",
