    {
      q: "How is hydro jetting different from snaking?",
      a: "Snaking punches a hole through the clog. Hydro jetting cleans the entire inner diameter of the pipe with high-pressure water, removing buildup that grows the clog back. Jetting prevents recurrence.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is hydro jetting safe for my pipes?",
      a: "On healthy modern pipes, yes. We always camera-inspect first to confirm the line can handle the pressure. If pipes are cracked or fragile, we recommend repair before jetting.",
    },
    {
      q: "How often should I get my main line jetted?",
      a: "Homes with frequent grease, tree-root issues, or older clay lines benefit from every 12–18 months. Average homes can go a few years between professional jettings.",
    },
    {
      q: "Will hydro jetting clear tree roots?",
      a: "Yes, we use a root-cutting jetter head specifically for this. For severe root intrusion, we may recommend trenchless sewer repair as a longer-term fix.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long does a hydro jetting service take?",
      a: "Most residential jobs run 1–2 hours including camera inspection. Larger commercial lines can take longer depending on length and severity.",
