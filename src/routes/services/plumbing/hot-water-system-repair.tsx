    {
      q: "How long should a hot water tank last?",
      a: "Most standard tank-style water heaters last 8–12 years. Tankless units can last 20+ years with proper maintenance. If yours is near or past these ranges, plan for replacement rather than another repair.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is no hot water always the heating element?",
      a: "Not always. On gas units it's often the pilot, igniter, or thermocouple. On electric, it's usually a heating element or thermostat. We diagnose first, then repair only what's actually failed.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why does my hot water smell metallic or look rusty?",
      a: "Usually corrosion inside the tank or the anode rod nearing end of life. A new anode rod is cheap and can buy you years; a corroded tank itself usually needs replacement.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can sediment really damage my water heater?",
      a: "Yes, it insulates the burner from the water, forcing the unit to run longer, which overheats components. An annual flush keeps things efficient and extends the unit's life.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you handle gas water heaters?",
      a: "Yes, burner, valve, venting, and safety inspections included. All repairs are done to code by licensed plumbers.",
