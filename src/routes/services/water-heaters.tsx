    },
    {
      q: "Why is my water heater making popping noises?",
      a: "Popping or rumbling is usually sediment buildup at the tank bottom hitting the heating element. An annual flush usually solves it; if it doesn't, the tank may be near end of life.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is a tankless water heater worth the cost?",
      a: "For most Seattle homes, yes — over a 20-year span tankless typically saves money on energy bills and lasts twice as long as a tank. We'll run the numbers for your home before recommending one.",

    {
      q: "How quickly can you install a new water heater?",
      a: "We stock the most common tank sizes and can usually complete a same-day replacement. Tankless installs typically take 4–8 hours depending on whether gas or electrical upgrades are needed.",

    {
      q: "Do you handle the permit?",
      a: "Yes — water heater installs in Seattle require a permit, and we pull and close it as part of every install. You'll have proper paperwork for your insurance and home sale.",
