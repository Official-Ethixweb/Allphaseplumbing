      a: "If you're experiencing leaks in multiple locations, have very old pipes (galvanized steel over 40 years, copper over 50 years), or face repeated repair costs, full replacement is often more cost-effective. We'll assess your system and give an honest recommendation.",

    {
      q: "What types of pipes do you replace with?",
      a: "We most commonly use PEX (cross-linked polyethylene) for its flexibility, corrosion resistance, and longevity. Copper is also available. We'll recommend the best material for your specific situation.",

      q: "Will pipe replacement require opening my walls?",
