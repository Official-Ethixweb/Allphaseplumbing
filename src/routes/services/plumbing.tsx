      q: "Why does my garbage disposal smell?",

    },
    {
      q: "Why is my water pressure low?",
      a: "Low water pressure can be caused by clogged pipes, leaks, mineral buildup, or issues with the municipal supply. Our plumbers can diagnose the root cause and restore proper pressure throughout your home.",
    },
    {
      q: "What should I do if my toilet keeps running?",
      a: "A constantly running toilet usually points to a worn flapper, faulty fill valve, or float issue. These are inexpensive parts to replace, but we'll inspect and fix the right component to stop the water waste.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why do my drains keep clogging?",
      a: "Repeat clogs often mean buildup deeper in the line — grease, soap scum, or tree roots. We use hydro-jetting and camera inspection to clear and verify the line, not just snake the surface.",
    },
    {
      q: "How can I prevent my pipes from freezing in winter?",
      a: "Insulate exposed pipes, keep your home above 55°F, let faucets drip during hard freezes, and disconnect outdoor hoses before winter. We also offer pipe insulation and freeze-prevention services.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why is my water heater making noise?",
      a: "Popping or rumbling typically means sediment buildup at the tank bottom. Flushing the tank annually helps; if noises persist, the heating element or tank itself may need service or replacement.",
