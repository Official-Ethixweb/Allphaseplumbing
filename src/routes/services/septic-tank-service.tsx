    {
      q: "How often should I have my septic tank pumped?",
      a: "Most septic tanks should be pumped every 3-5 years, depending on household size and tank capacity. High-use households may need more frequent service. Regular pumping prevents solids from overflowing into the drain field.",
    },
    {
      q: "What are the signs my septic tank is full?",
      a: "Signs include slow drains throughout the home, gurgling sounds, sewage odors indoors or outdoors, and wet or soggy areas near the drain field. Don't wait for a complete backup, schedule service at the first sign of trouble.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I use a garbage disposal with a septic system?",
      a: "Yes, but with caution. Garbage disposals increase the amount of solids entering your tank, which can require more frequent pumping. We recommend using it sparingly and scheduling more regular maintenance.",
    },
    {
      q: "What should I never put in a septic system?",
      a: "Avoid flushing wipes (even 'flushable' ones), feminine hygiene products, medications, cooking grease, or harsh chemicals. These can disrupt the bacterial balance in your tank or cause clogs.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I know if my drain field is failing?",
      a: "Signs include soggy or unusually green grass over the drain field, sewage surfacing above ground, slow drains, or sewage backing up into the home. A failing drain field requires immediate professional attention.",
