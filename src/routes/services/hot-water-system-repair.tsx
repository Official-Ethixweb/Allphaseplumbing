  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Why do I have no hot water?",
      a: "No hot water is commonly caused by a failed heating element (electric systems), a faulty gas burner or pilot light (gas systems), a tripped circuit breaker, or a failed thermostat. Call us for fast diagnosis and repair.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long do hot water systems last?",
      a: "Traditional tank water heaters typically last 8-12 years. Tankless units can last 20+ years with proper maintenance. If your system is nearing the end of its lifespan, repairs may not be cost-effective compared to replacement.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is it normal for a hot water heater to make noise?",
      a: "Popping, rumbling, or banging sounds usually indicate sediment buildup at the bottom of the tank. Flushing the tank can help, but if noises persist, a professional inspection is recommended.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I repair a leaking water heater?",
      a: "Small leaks from fittings or valves can often be repaired. However, leaks from the tank itself usually mean the tank has corroded through and replacement is necessary. We'll assess which option is right for you.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I know when to repair vs. replace my hot water system?",
      a: "If your system is under 8 years old and the repair cost is under half the cost of a new unit, repair is usually the better choice. For older systems with recurring problems, replacement often provides better long-term value.",
