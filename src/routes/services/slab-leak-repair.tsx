Rising water bills, warm spots on floors, or cracks in flooring are common signs that something is wrong below the surface.",

    },
    {
      q: "Can a slab leak be repaired without breaking the concrete?",
      a: "In some cases, yes. Pipe rerouting, running new pipes through walls or ceilings to bypass the damaged section, can avoid concrete breaking. In other cases, targeted concrete cutting is necessary but we minimize the area affected.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long does slab leak repair take?",
      a: "Most slab leak repairs take 1-3 days depending on the access method and extent of the damage. Rerouting jobs may be faster than those requiring concrete cutting.",
    },
    {
      q: "What causes slab leaks?",
      a: "Common causes include pipe corrosion, shifting soil or foundation movement, poor original installation, abrasion from the concrete, and high water pressure. Copper pipes in older homes are especially prone to pinhole leaks under slabs.",
    },
    {
      q: "Will my homeowner's insurance cover slab leak repair?",
      a: "Many homeowners insurance policies cover the cost of breaking through the slab and making the repair, but not the pipe replacement itself. Coverage varies, we can provide documentation to help with your claim.",
