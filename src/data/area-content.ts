  intro: [
    "All Phase Plumbing has kept water flowing in Seattle homes since 1989. From the early-1900s Craftsman bungalows of Wallingford and Ballard to the hillside houses of Queen Anne and the newer builds along the waterfront, our licensed plumbers have worked on just about every kind of plumbing system this city has. That hands-on local experience means we usually know what's wrong before we even open the wall, and we fix it in a way that lasts.",
    "Seattle's wet climate, mature trees, and aging infrastructure put real stress on residential plumbing. Tree roots invade clay sewer laterals, decades-old galvanized supply lines corrode and lose pressure, and heavy winter rain overwhelms basements without a working sump pump. We handle all of it, and we back every repair with upfront, flat-rate pricing and a written workmanship guarantee, so there are no surprises when the invoice arrives.",

      paragraphs: [
        "A huge share of Seattle's housing stock was built before 1950, and original galvanized steel or polybutylene piping is still hiding behind plenty of walls. Over time those materials corrode from the inside out, which shows up as rusty water, weak pressure in the upstairs shower, or pinhole leaks that quietly rot framing. Our team specializes in whole-home repiping with modern PEX and copper, sequenced to keep your water on and your daily routine intact while the work is done.",
        "We also see a lot of dated fixtures and DIY repairs that were never quite to code. When we replace a faucet, toilet, water heater, or shut-off valve, we bring everything up to current Washington plumbing standards and pull permits where the city requires them. That protects your home's value and saves you headaches if you ever sell.",

      heading: "Drain, Sewer & Stormwater Care for a Rainy City",

        "Few places test a drainage system like Seattle. Constant rain, steep lots, and old side sewers built from clay or Orangeburg pipe are a recipe for backups, especially in neighborhoods like Beacon Hill, Columbia City, and West Seattle where mature trees send roots straight into the joints. We clear blockages fast with hydro-jetting and mechanical snaking, then drop a camera down the line so you can see exactly what caused the problem instead of guessing.",
        "When a sewer line is cracked, bellied, or collapsed, we offer trenchless repair and replacement that restores the line without tearing up your yard, driveway, or established landscaping. We also install and service sump pumps and backwater valves to keep stormwater out of finished basements through the worst of the winter season.",

Our emergency line is answered around the clock, every day of the year, and with trucks staged across King County we can usually have a licensed Seattle plumber at your door within the hour to stop the damage and get things working again.",
