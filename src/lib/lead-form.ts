/**
 * lead-form.ts
 *
 * Client helper shared by every lead-capture form on the site. Reads the
 * submitted fields straight off the <form> element (via FormData, so it works
 * with the existing uncontrolled inputs — just give each input a `name`) and
 * hands them to the sendLeadEmail server function.
 *
 * Usage in a form's submit handler:
 *
 *   onSubmit={async (e) => {
 *     e.preventDefault();
 *     const form = e.currentTarget;            // capture BEFORE any await
 *     if (await captcha.verify()) {
 *       await submitLeadFromForm(form, { source: "Contact Page", service });
 *       setSent(true);
 *     }
 *   }}
 *
 * A mail hiccup never blocks the user's success state — failures are logged
 * (client console + server console) but the form still confirms to the visitor.
